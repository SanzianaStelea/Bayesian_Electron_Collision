# Bayesian Analysis of the Z boson invariant mass spectrum 

- In this project we use the Bayesian workflow to model the invariant mass spectrum observed for dielecton events at the CMS Experiment at CERN
- Used dataset can be found at https://opendata.cern.ch/record/304
  
This is the repository of Stefan Solomon and Sanziana Stelea, MSc Physics students at ETH. It includes the project for the Bayesian Statistical Methods and Data Analysis course.

## Project Overview

Details and final results of the analysis can be found in a structured way here:

Final plots are not yet uploaded in the repository, but can be found in the report above

## Repository Structure
- `bayesian_model.py` contains the functions used for the analysis
- `exp_gauss_crystal_ball_poisson.ipynb` + other notebooks contain the analysis and the results
